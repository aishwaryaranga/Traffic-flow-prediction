## Description

The project name is traffic flow prediction using kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/coplin/traffic). Google colaboratory notebook is available.
In this task I managed to apply my knowledge in the data science field such as data pre-processing ( data cleaning, outlier detection, 
data formatting) and use exploratory data analytics techniques to find out patterns among features. Moreover, I applied a machine learning regressor model together with Deep Learning LSTM model.

#### Techniques

- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Machine Learning and Data Visualization
- Deep Learning (LSTM)
